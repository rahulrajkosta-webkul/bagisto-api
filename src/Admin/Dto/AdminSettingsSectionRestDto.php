/**
 * REST output for AdminSettingsSection (detail + listing). Snake_case props surface
 * as camelCase via the central converter (provider writes camelCase; the trait
 * maps it). `translations` is a flat JSON array (`[{locale, options}]`) over REST;
 * over GraphQL the same data is served as a connection off the AdminSettingsSection
 * Eloquent resource.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (the output:-DTO name-match trap, see CLAUDE.md OrderDetail notes):
 * with `output:` set, API Platform only serialises DTO props whose names match an
 * attribute/relation on the AdminSettingsSection Eloquent resource — so the
 * translations block MUST be named `translations` (the relation).
